# JavaScript-2D-game-dev-Library
custom JavaScript library with a 2D vector class and helper functions for vector operations, utility functions for  rendering polygons , helper functions for collision detection , resolution and contact points generation.
All this is achieved using HTML canvas.

The sample code demonstrates the use of SAT algorithm for collision detection and SutherLand Hodgeman Clipping algorithm for contact points generation.
The polygons are also drawn using the drawing utility functions.
